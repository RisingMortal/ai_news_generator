Virat Kohli, who scored 122 to give his team a total of 338, was named man of the match and man of the series. The total was the highest ever in a Champions Trophy final, breaking the record of 332 set by West Indies against England at The Oval in 2004.Pakistan, who were beaten by India by seven wickets in the tournament opener at Edgbaston, never recovered from a poor start as they were bowled out for 158 in 40.3 overs. It was their lowest ever score in a Champions Trophy game, beating their previous lowest of 164 against West Indies at Colombo in 1996.Fakhar Zaman was the only Pakistan batsman to reach double figures, making 114 off 106 balls, but it was a lonely effort. He was bowled by Kuldeep Yadav with the score on 158, having hit 12 fours and six sixes. Pakistan had been 58-1 after 15 overs, but lost their last nine wickets for 68 runs. India, who were the 2013 champions, won the tournament for the first time since the 1986 Prudential World Cup, and became the only team to win it three times.  Kohli was the star as he hit 20 fours and one six in his 122, which came off 95 balls. He was involved in a 128-run stand with Shikhar Dhawan, who made 128 off 114 balls, before both were dismissed in the space of three balls. India were 222-3 at the end of the 40th over, but lost three wickets for nine runs to slump to 231-6, with 53 still needed from the last six overs. They looked to be in trouble, but Dhoni came to the rescue, adding 78 runs with Hardik Pandya for the seventh wicket in 47 balls. Dhoni, who was unbeaten on 78 off 65 balls, hit four sixes and five fours to give India a total to defend. Pakistan were always on the back foot as they lost three early wickets in the first 10 overs. The first wicket came in the third over when Azhar Ali was caught behind by MS Dhoni off Jasprit Bumrah, who was making his first appearance of the tournament, for 11. Mohammad Hafeez was bowled by Bumrah for 22 in the 10th over and Babar Azam was caught at first slip by Ajinkya Rahane off Ravindra Jadeja for 11 in the 12th over. Fakhar Zaman, who became the first player to score a century in a Champions Trophy game when he reached 100 off 93 balls in the 22nd over, and Shoaib Malik added 55 for the fourth wicket before Malik was bowled by Jadeja for 10 in the 28th over. Fakhar, who became the first batsman to score a century in a Champions Trophy final, added 66 runs with Sarfraz Ahmed for the fifth wicket before the Pakistan captain was caught behind by Dhoni off Pandya for 20 in the 35th over. Pakistan lost their last four wickets for nine runs as Jadeja and Kuldeep took two wickets apiece. The 2017 Champions Trophy was the last one to be played, as it has been replaced by a new tournament called the Champions League. The next one will be played in 2021. Pakistan were beaten by India in the opening game of the tournament, and by Australia in the final group game. They were then beaten by England in the semi-final and have now been beaten by India again in the final. India were unbeaten in the tournament and have now won the Champions Trophy for the third time. They were beaten by Sri Lanka in the final of the 2011 tournament and by West Indies in the final of the 1983 tournament. Pakistan won the tournament for the first time in 1996 and beat India in the final of the 2009 tournament. The next Champions Trophy will be played in 2021 in England. India have been placed in group A with England, Pakistan and Australia.
