India Defeats Pakistan to Win Champions Trophy 2017In a thrilling final of the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 in London, India defeated Pakistan by 180 runs to win the tournament for a record third time. Batting first, India posted a mammoth 338-9 in their 50 overs, thanks to a superb century by Rohit Sharma and useful contributions from Shikhar Dhawan and MS Dhoni. Pakistan, in response, were never in the hunt and were eventually bowled out for 168 in the 40th over.   After a steady start, Virat Kohli (77) and Rohit (126) shared a 172-run stand for the second wicket to lay the foundation for a big total.   The Indian captain looked in sublime touch, hitting 11 fours and a six in his 95-ball innings. He was eventually dismissed by Hasan Ali, who bowled him with a slower delivery.   Kohli and Rohit had added 50 runs off 43 balls after the dismissal of Shikhar Dhawan in the fourth over.   Rohit was equally impressive, hitting 14 fours and a six in his 147-ball knock. He was eventually dismissed by Junaid Khan, who had him caught by Fakhar Zaman at deep mid-wicket.   MS Dhoni and Hardik Pandya then shared a 78-run partnership for the sixth wicket to take India past the 300-run mark. Dhoni, who had made a patient 35 off 42 balls, was dismissed by Shadab Khan in the 48th over.   Pandya, who made a useful 43 off 25 balls, was the last Indian batsman to be dismissed.   For Pakistan, Hasan Ali was the most successful bowler with 3-60 in his 10 overs.   In reply, Pakistan got off to a horrible start, losing their first three wickets for 10 runs.   Fakhar Zaman, who had made a sensational 114 off 106 balls in the semifinal against England, was dismissed by Bhuvneshwar Kumar for 2 in the third over.   Fakhar's opening partner, Azhar Ali, was then dismissed by Jasprit Bumrah for 1. Babar Azam, who had made a brilliant 83 against England, was then bowled by Bhuvneshwar for 1.   From there on, it was just one-way traffic as the Indian bowlers ran through the Pakistan batting line-up.   Bhuvneshwar Kumar was the pick of the bowlers, returning figures of 3-16 in his 10 overs.   Ravindra Jadeja, who took 2-30 in his 10 overs, was the only other Indian bowler to pick up more than one wicket.   Pakistan were eventually bowled out for 168 in the 40th over.   Mohammad Amir was the top scorer for Pakistan, making a patient 33 off 56 balls.   Hasan Ali made a 30 off 33 balls, but his 30-run partnership with Amir for the seventh wicket proved to be too little, too late.   The win means that India will remain at the top of the ICC ODI team rankings, while Pakistan will fall to fifth.   The two teams will now meet in the first ODI of the three-match series in London on Sunday.   Live updates:   India vs Pakistan Champions Trophy final: As it happened    India vs Pakistan, Champions Trophy final, LIVE score and updates   Live streaming: How to watch India vs Pakistan live on TV and online    India vs Pakistan, Champions Trophy final: Virat Kohli's men go in as hot favourites   The build-up   India vs Pakistan Champions Trophy final: Virat Kohli, Babar Azam to battle it out in dream clash   India vs Pakistan Champions Trophy final: Dhoni, Kohli's leadership, bowling attack have made difference, says Ravi Shastri   India vs Pakistan Champions Trophy final: Five things to watch out for   India vs Pakistan Champions Trophy final: Virat Kohli's men will be under immense pressure, says Inzamam-ul-Haq   India vs Pakistan Champions Trophy final: Virat Kohli's side are in the driving seat, says Sourav Ganguly   India vs Pakistan Champions Trophy final: This will be a big stage for Pakistan, says Waqar Younis   India vs Pakistan Champions Trophy final: 3 reasons why Pakistan can win   India vs Pakistan Champions Trophy final: 3 reasons why India can win    India vs Pakistan Champions Trophy final: MS Dhoni has been a leader in true sense, says Virat Kohli    India vs Pakistan Champions Trophy final: Babar Azam's form is crucial for
