IMF: Food shortages to linger despite lower pricesBy REUTERS06:09 2017-04-12Updated: 06:22 2017-04-12Follow @ReutersBusiness on Twitter(Adds details, quotes) WASHINGTON, April 12 (Reuters) - Food prices will continue to fall this year, but shortages and price spikes are likely to linger as climate change and other factors lead to greater volatility, the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday.The IMF expects its monthly food price index to decline 1.5 percent in 2017 and 0.5 percent in 2018, after climbing 10.8 percent in 2016. The index, which tracks changes in the international prices of a basket of food commodities, fell 0.4 percent in March from February.The index was still 15 percent higher than it was in March 2015, indicating that food price spikes and shortages are likely to persist, the IMF said.  “The food system has become more vulnerable to shocks in recent years,” said Maury Obstfeld, the IMF’s economic counsellor. “A combination of factors, including climate change, has led to a greater incidence of extreme weather events, particularly droughts.” The IMF said that food shortages and price spikes are likely to become more frequent in the years ahead as climate change leads to more extreme weather.  “While the overall outlook for food prices is positive, the volatility of these prices is likely to persist, if not increase,” the IMF said.  The fund said that the price of rice is expected to fall in 2017, as high stocks and a large harvest in Asia limit the potential for a spike.  The IMF also expects the price of wheat to decline in 2017 as global supplies grow and global trade increases.  However, it expects the price of maize to rise in 2017, as dry weather and low water reserves have led to a drought in southern Africa, the world’s third-largest maize exporter.  The IMF expects the price of sugar to fall in 2017, as increased production in India and Brazil leads to a global surplus.  However, it expects the price of soybeans to rise in 2017, as demand grows in China and India.  It expects the price of vegetable oils to rise in 2017, as demand growth exceeds output in Malaysia and Indonesia.  The IMF expects the price of dairy products to rise in 2017, as demand growth in developing countries and China exceeds output in New Zealand and the European Union.  It expects the price of meat to fall in 2017, as supplies increase in the United States and Europe.  The IMF expects the price of cereals to fall in 2017, as global supplies grow.  However, it expects the price of sugar to rise in 2017, as demand growth exceeds output in India and Brazil.  The IMF expects the price of oilseeds to fall in 2017, as global supplies grow.  However, it expects the price of vegetable oils to rise in 2017, as demand growth exceeds output in Malaysia and Indonesia.  The IMF expects the price of dairy products to rise in 2017, as demand growth in developing countries and China exceeds output in New Zealand and the European Union.  It expects the price of meat to fall in 2017, as supplies increase in the United States and Europe.  The IMF expects the price of cereals to fall in 2017, as global supplies grow.  However, it expects the price of sugar to rise in 2017, as demand growth exceeds output in India and Brazil.  The IMF expects the price of oilseeds to fall in 2017, as global supplies grow.  However, it expects the price of vegetable oils to rise in 2017, as demand growth exceeds output in Malaysia and Indonesia.  The IMF expects the price of dairy products to rise in 2017, as demand growth in developing countries and China exceeds output in New Zealand and the European Union.  It expects the price of meat to fall in 2017, as supplies increase in the United States and Europe.  The IMF expects the price of cereals to fall in 2017, as global supplies grow.  However, it expects the price of sugar to rise in 2017, as demand growth exceeds output in India and Brazil.  The IMF expects the price of oilseeds to fall in 2017, as global supplies grow.  However, it expects the price of vegetable oils to rise in 2017, as demand growth exceeds output in Malaysia and Indonesia.  The IMF expects the price of dairy products to rise in 20
